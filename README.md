# Efficient-Traffic-Flow-Monitoring-through-Dual-Stream-Radar-Data-Fusion

# Abstract
This study presents a powerful realtime traffic monitoring system
that employs mmWave radar and deep learning to solve the barriers
posed by LiDAR, cameras and sensors, especially in compromised
conditions. Our system uses frequency-modulated continuous-wave
(FMCW) radar in order to generate the range-Doppler and range-
Azimuth signals for measuring in 2D power spectrum images.
All those images are processed on a dual-branch neural network
(Doppler category using MobileNetV2 and Azimuth one with Xcep-
tion) to detect the presence of vehicles. The class balanced and vali-
dated load works to fine-tune the model to enhance generalization.
The results confirm that such a radar-based approach provides effec-
tive monitoring of traffic in varied conditions and opens avenues for
smart urban mobility and transportation management.
