# Efficient-Traffic-Flow-Monitoring-through-Dual-Stream-Radar-Data-Fusion
This study presents a real-time traffic monitoring system using mmWave radar and deep learning, overcoming limits of LiDAR and cameras in challenging conditions. FMCW radar generates range-Doppler and range-Azimuth data, processed with MobileNetV2 and Xception models to detect vehicles.
